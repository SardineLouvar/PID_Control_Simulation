# Simulation of an Airtight room with a HVAC system

This project simulates a controlled room environment, generating time-series data that is exposed via JSON APIs for seamless integration with an external system (`backend/services`). The data is stored in either dataframe or SQL form (determined using the `config.yaml` file) the data is plotted. Finally, the project is cleaned of any generated files. A final cleanup routine ensures the project remains organized by removing all generated artifacts.


## How to run (Windows)
1. Download the entire project and extract it where you want to run it.
2. In `config.yaml` change the database_type to either "dataframe" to produce the uncontrolled simulation, or "sql" for the HVAC-controlled simulation. It is set to sql by default.
3. Open a terminal and ensure that the current working directory is the extracted project folder. For example, open the folder in an IDE like Visual Studio Code, or run `cd path\to\folder`.
4. Make a virtual environment and install dependencies by running:
`python -m venv venv && venv\scripts\activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the `main.py` file using `python -m backend.main` from the root folder.

## Simulation
The following project contains a simulation of an airtight, isolated room filled with industrial equipment and workers. The workers produce carbon dioxide and consume oxygen, and the industrial equipment raise or lower the overall temperature of the room. The model is simplified and somewhat unrealistic, however I wanted a mixture of changes to the environment of the room to test the control with. A HVAC system is used to control the temperature, CO2 concentration and O2 concentration of the room using a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control scheme.

### Model assumptions
- All thermal energy goes into the air (no absorbtion by walls, equipment, people etc.)
- Completely uniform temperature and composition of air in the room.
- The composition of air in the room does not affect the volume of oxygen consumed / co2 expelled
- No temperature or concentration gradient effect that make it more difficult to increase / decrease the temp and concs at extreme conditions.

## To Do
- Make tests for Pytest to check edge cases.

## Notes
- Cursor was used to generate the file structure diagram, but the descriptions were added myself.
